When designing this app, we tried to find an easy and fun way for the users to track their
daily energy consumption as well as provide them with the necessary information that
allows them to understand how they can cut down on their spending.
We also decided that it will be good to encourage the user to take part in a monthly ecofriendly
challenge that can help the user learn more about recycling and other ways to
help keep the planet green. In addition to that, the user will be able to see in numbers
how much their participation in this challenge will affect the planet. We also made the
decision to make it only one challenge a month because we observed that people usually
get overexcited when they first get introduced to something, so to avoid the user
choosing multiple challenges in the beginning and slowly getting bored or overwhelmed
by the amount of work they have to do we limited it to one challenge a month that the
user can focus on.
We designed this app with the goal to make understanding the concept of energy
consumption easy for the average user.
Overall, it's a visual way for people to monitor the impact they have on their energy
consumption over time.
